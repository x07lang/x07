# Provenance and signing

This document describes how release artifacts can be verified.

## Release manifest

Each release should include `dist/release-manifest.json`, generated by `scripts/build_release_manifest.py`.

The manifest records:

- The git SHA used to build the release
- The pinned lockfiles and their hashes
- The canonical schema files and their hashes

## Signing and provenance

Provenance inputs are recorded in `dist/release-manifest.json` (see `scripts/build_release_manifest.py`).
Signing is performed by the release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) when configured.
