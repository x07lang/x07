# Stability policy

X07 prioritizes determinism and stable machine-readable contracts.

## ABI and contracts

- The solver I/O ABI is defined in `docs/spec/x07-c-backend.md`.
- JSON schemas under `spec/` define the canonical tool contracts.

Any breaking change to the solver ABI or canonical schemas requires an RFC and a versioned migration path.
