# Provenance and signing

This document describes how release artifacts can be verified.

## Release manifest

Each release should include `dist/release-manifest.json`, generated by `scripts/build_release_manifest.py`.

The manifest records:

- The git SHA used to build the release
- The pinned lockfiles and their hashes
- The canonical schema files and their hashes

## Signing and provenance

Signing and provenance generation are tracked in `docs/phases/x07-production-plan.md` (REL-05).
