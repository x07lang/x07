# Trademarks

This project may use trademarks (for example, the name "X07") to help users
identify official builds and official documentation.

## Allowed use

You may:

- Refer to X07 to describe that your project is compatible with X07.
- Describe a fork as "X07-derived" if it is clearly not presented as official.
- Package or distribute X07 as long as you do not imply endorsement.

## Not allowed without permission

You may not:

- Present a modified toolchain as an official X07 build.
- Use the X07 name or logos in a way that implies endorsement by the maintainers.
- Use confusingly similar names for forks or distributions.

## Official builds

"Official builds" are defined in `docs/official-builds.md`.
