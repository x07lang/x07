# x07import fixtures

This directory contains deterministic import fixtures used by `x07import` tests and CI to keep generated X07 modules stable over time.

It is not part of the end-user language surface.

## Layout

- `import_sources/`: restricted Rust/C inputs plus `manifest.json` for the importer batch.
