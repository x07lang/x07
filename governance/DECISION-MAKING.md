# Decision making

## Default rule: consensus

Most changes should be decided by consensus in PR review and issue discussion.

## When an RFC is required

Changes that require an RFC are listed in `governance/RFC-REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Approval

- Non-RFC changes: at least one maintainer approval.
- RFC changes: follow the RFC process in `x07lang/x07-rfcs` and require core-team approval.

## Disagreements

If consensus cannot be reached:

1. Clarify the decision being made and list the options.
2. Document tradeoffs (correctness, determinism, stability, security, complexity).
3. The core team makes the final decision.

## Releases

Releases are owned by the core team and/or delegated release managers.
Release artifacts and verification rules are defined in `docs/releases.md` and `docs/official-builds.md`.
