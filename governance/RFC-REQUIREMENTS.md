# RFC requirements

An RFC is required for any change that affects:

- Language surface and core semantics
- Solver ABI, including the C backend contract
- Canonical schemas and JSON contracts (`spec/*.schema.json`)
- Determinism guarantees or resource-bounding rules
- Stdlib baselines and world surfaces
- Package formats, lockfiles, registry protocol, and index format

RFCs live in `x07lang/x07-rfcs` and must follow `x07lang/x07-rfcs/process.md`.
